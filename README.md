# Weight-Manager
POSEIDON project - Weight Manager Android App

Adults with Down syndrome are more likely to be obese than their typically developed peers. It can be result of untreated hypothyroidism, but it can also be due to intake of too many calories in relation to the level of physical activity. There are many strategies to prevent it, such as lowering portion sizes or avoiding snacks, but the most effective strategy is to empower the users to monitor their own weight to learn how to control it. The aim of this project was to create a tool adapted to their needs which would allow them to control their weight and physical activity. The tool developed was a smartphone application based on activity monitoring using different sensors from the phone and external devices. It also combined specific notifications and reminders to help Down syndrome people live more independently. This application was tested by people with Down syndrome and carers and feedback was gathered through a questionnaire. Results showed that both people with Down syndrome and carers found the application useful and liked the design, pointing out the opportunities for further development this application provides.
